# Healing-Targets-Heatmap

maybe can expand to include total damage taken and total healing recieved (may have to convert to unit millions, also not sure how i will deal with decimals eg. 4.5M)
are we able to assign numbers to each coordinate?\

maybe ill add webscraping into this one day too\


Would love to eventually include mouse movement once i find a pain-free way of tracking cursor movements in a vod

maybe if i arrange my raidframes in alphabetical order i wont need to map the players out? just read from data and then put into a 5x4 frame
