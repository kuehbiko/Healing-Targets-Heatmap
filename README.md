# Raid Healing Targets Visualisation

Visualisation for World of Warcraft. 2D histogram depicting the number of heals cast per raid member in a 20-man raid.

Input: Excel spreadsheet contain casts data from WarcraftLogs and raidframe layout \
Output: 4x5 2D histogram coloured by number of heals each player recieved


Enhancements:
- Would love to be able to use an API call to scrape information from WCL
- Raidframes are automatically ordered by role (Tank/Melee/Ranged/Healer). Would be nice to enable such organization in the code so no need to input raidframe manually.
