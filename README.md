# Healing-Targets-Heatmap

maybe can expand to include total damage taken and total healing recieved (may have to convert to unit millions, also not sure how i will deal with decimals eg. 4.5M)
are we able to assign numbers to each coordinate?\


Would love to eventually include mouse movement once i find a pain-free way of tracking cursor movements in a vod
